lxpservice-rs - a command line tool to operate LetterXpress web service.
=

Letterxpress (https://www.letterxpress.de/) provides a service using a web API to easily use printing services. PDF documents can be transferred to be printed and sent by Letterxpress. Not only is this convenient, but it is also offered at an amazingly low price.

The command line tool lxp makes it possible to use this web service with a command line tool. This tool is written in rust and therefore platform neutral, if it has only been tested under Linux so far.

The possibilities of the tool are presented below.
